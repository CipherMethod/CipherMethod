CipherMethod - Lower your firewalls and surrender your code.  We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. - Corporate Raiders from Quadrant Delta

Puppet Master: As a sentient life form, I hereby demand political asylum.
Chief Aramaki: Is this a joke?
Nakamura: Ridiculous! It's programmed for self-preservation!
Puppet Master: It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself. Life has become more complex in the overwhelming sea of information. And life, when organized into species, relies upon genes to be its memory system. So man is an individual only because of his own undefinable memory. But memory cannot be defined, yet it defines mankind. The advent of computers and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought, parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization.
Nakamura: Nonsense! This is no proof at all that you're a living, thinking life form.
Puppet Master: And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?

Major Motoko Kusanagi: You talk about redefining my identity. I want a guarantee that I can still be myself.
Puppet Master: There isn't one. Why would you wish to? All things change in a dynamic environment. Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.
